//! # Run-to-Completion (RTC) — External Event Loop
//!
//! Transition actions in phyto-fsm are atomic: the FSM is mutably borrowed for
//! the entire transition, so an action cannot call back into the FSM to trigger
//! another event. Rust's borrow checker enforces this at compile time.
//!
//! When an action needs to trigger a follow-up event, one way is to use a channel to signal
//! the intent and process it in an external event loop after the transition completes.
